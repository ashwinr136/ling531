    "\n",
    "1. For this assignment, you will edit this jupyter notebook and turn it in. Do not turn in pdf files or separate `.py` files.\n",
    "1. Late work is not accepted.\n",
    "1. Given the way I grade, you should try to answer *every* question, even if you don't like your answer or have to guess.\n",
    "1. You may *not* use `python` modules that we have not already used in class. (For grading, it needs to be able to run on my machine, and the way to do that is to limit yourself to the modules we've discussed and that are loaded into the Notebook.)\n",
    "1. Don't use editors *other* than Jupyter Notebook to work on and submit your assignment, since they will mangle the autograding features: Google Colab, or even just editing the `.ipynb` file as a plain text file. Diagnosing and fixing that kind of problem takes a lot of my time, and that means less of my time to offer constructive feedback to you and to other students.\n",
    "1. You may certainly talk to your classmates about the assignment, but everybody must turn in *their own* work. It is not acceptable to turn in work that is essentially the same as the work of classmates. Using someone else's code and simply changing variable or object names is *not* doing your own work.\n",
    "1. All code must run. It doesn't have to be perfect, it may not do all that you want it to do, but it must run without error. Code that runs with errors will get no credit from the autograder.\n",
    "1. Code must run in reasonable time. Assume that if it takes more than *5 minutes* to run (on your machine), that's too long.\n",
    "1. Make sure to select `restart, run all cells` from the `kernel` menu when you're done and before you turn this in!"

    "\n",
    "**This is due Tuesday, October 17, 2023 at noon (Arizona time).**\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment deals with the `NewB` corpus. We'll be using this is many of our later homeworks, as well. You should download it from [here](https://github.com/JerryWei03/NewB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start, here's a bit of background to get you headed in the right direction. In general contexts, the terms *file* and *document* can often be used interchangeably. However, in the following explanation, we follow the readings and the lecture in using them with these formal definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*file* --> a unit on our computer in which data is stored\n",
    "\n",
    "*document* --> an abstract unit of text in our corpus that we will be searching over, which we define based on the nature of our corpus and the kinds of results that we think will be most useful to users; one or more documents will be the units that we want to return to users as a result of a search query; the set of all documents is called the collection, and each document is described by a unique document ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the tasks that we need to do to prepare for searching a collection is to separate the documents in the collection from [metadata about those documents](https://bernardmarr.com/what-is-metadata-a-simple-explanation-of-what-everyone-should-know/#:~:text=Quite%20simply%3A%20metadata%20is%20data,web%20pages%2C%20content%20or%20spreadsheets.). In the video lectures, the documents that comprise our collection are blog posts, and the metadata for each post includes an author identifier, the author's age and gender, the author's interests, and the author's zodiacal sign. The posts for a single author are arranged in a single file. The metadata about those documents is found in the file names, and one of the first tasks that Mike does in the lectures is to write a function to read in the documents (ie, each post) and link each document with its metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question on the homework, you need to think about these same issues for the NewB corpus. What are the documents that comprise this collection, that we will be searching over, and that we will be returning as the result of a query? What metadata do we have about each document? How is all of this stored in a file that we will read in, so that we can build an index? To answer this question, you may need to read the paper that describes the NewB corpus, which you can find in the Readings module. In this homework, you will see which of the files from the corpus we will be working with. Look at the docstrings for the two functions you need to build, and see what their arguments and their output will be like. Read the assert statements to see what tests will be performed on the output, and that will also give you clues about what data structure you should use."
