    "\n",
    "1. For this assignment, you will edit this jupyter notebook and turn it in. Do not turn in pdf files or separate `.py` files.\n",
    "1. Late work is not accepted.\n",
    "1. Given the way I grade, you should try to answer *every* question, even if you don't like your answer or have to guess.\n",
    "1. You may *not* use `python` modules that we have not already used in class. (For grading, it needs to be able to run on my machine, and the way to do that is to limit yourself to the modules we've discussed and that are loaded into the Notebook.)\n",
    "1. Don't use editors *other* than Jupyter Notebook to work on and submit your assignment, since they will mangle the autograding features: Google Colab, or even just editing the `.ipynb` file as a plain text file. Diagnosing and fixing that kind of problem takes a lot of my time, and that means less of my time to offer constructive feedback to you and to other students.\n",
    "1. You may certainly talk to your classmates about the assignment, but everybody must turn in *their own* work. It is not acceptable to turn in work that is essentially the same as the work of classmates. Using someone else's code and simply changing variable or object names is *not* doing your own work.\n",
    "1. All code must run. It doesn't have to be perfect, it may not do all that you want it to do, but it must run without error. Code that runs with errors will get no credit from the autograder.\n",
    "1. Code must run in reasonable time. Assume that if it takes more than *5 minutes* to run (on your machine), that's too long.\n",
    "1. Make sure to select `restart, run all cells` from the `kernel` menu when you're done and before you turn this in!"

    "You can do this with a single list comprehension for each value to be calculated (though you're not *forced* to use a list comprehension; you just need to get the right answer). Since we've imported NumPy, you may find some of its [statistical functions](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html) to be convenient. These were also used in the class notebook, which you can review for guidance. Again, please note the variable names from the comments and the following `assert` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you having trouble passing the `assert` statements? **Be sure you're preparing the data with a working tokenization function from question 4.** If that's working properly, then double-check that you're getting the proper number of words per sentence, and the proper number of letters per word.\n",

    "Also, for the word-level statistics, note that you [**cannot**](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/133138/will-the-mean-of-a-set-of-means-always-be-the-same-as-the-mean-obtained-from-the#:~:text=No%2C%20the%20averages%20of%20the,are%20the%20same%20sample%20size.) find the statistics at a sentence level (like a mean for the length of words in characters) and then average the per-sentence values across all sentences; that is not guaranteed to give you the same result as the overall mean word length. You must create a suitable data set (ie, over all words), and then calculate the statistics for all items in that data set. Note that your `train3`, `train7`, `test3`, `test7` data structures are effectively lists of lists of words; you might find [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952914/how-do-i-make-a-flat-list-out-of-a-list-of-lists) helpful for de-nesting a list of lists."

As a specific example, if (1) your test set has 10 sentences, and (2) that test set is taken from class 8, and (3) you give this function the mean length for the training data from class 8 in the position of `m2` (and some other mean in `m1`), then returning `10` would be a \"perfect\" score, which would mean this function classified 100% of the test set as the proper class; if the function returned `5`, then only 50% of the test set sentences were properly classified as class 8.*\n",
